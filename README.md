# EduCSW
This git aims to propose a pipeline for generating synthetic code-mixed datasets

*EduCSW_Data_Preparation_1.ipynb* -- this notebook documents parallel corpus creation, alignment texts processing, and feature extraction using BERT-NER.

*EduCSW_Encoder_Decoder_Architecture.ipynb* -- this notebook specifically documents the entire encoder-decoder code-mixed data generation model (along with training, implementation, as well as quick evaluation). The trained weights are saved on hugging face: [RuishiCh0314/EduCSW_model](https://huggingface.co/RuishiCh0314/EduCSW_model)
